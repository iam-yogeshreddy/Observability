# Observability

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 :

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including metrics, logs and traces.

Monitoring (Metrics) : involves tracing system metrics like, CPU usage, memory usage, networking performance. Providing alerts based on the predefined thresholds and conditions.

-> Monitoring tells us what is happening.

Logging(Logs): involves the collection of log data from various components of a system.

-> Logging explains why it is happening.

Tracing(Traces): involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system.

-> Tracing shows how it is happening.

* Monitoring helps us keep an eye on our systems to ensure they are working properly.

* Purpose: maintaining the health, performance, and security of IT environments.

* It enables early detection of issues, ensuring that they can be addressed before causing significant downtime or data loss.

We use monitoring to:

-> Detect Problems Early

-> Measure Performance

-> Ensure Availability

* Observability helps us understand why our systems are behaving the way they are.

* It’s like having a detailed map and tools to explore and diagnose issues.

We use observability to:

-> Diagnose Issues

-> Understand Behavior

-> Improve Systems
