# Observability

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 :

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including metrics, logs and traces.

Monitoring (Metrics) : involves tracing system metrics like, CPU usage, memory usage, networking performance. Providing alerts based on the predefined thresholds and conditions.

-> Monitoring tells us what is happening.

Logging(Logs): involves the collection of log data from various components of a system.

-> Logging explains why it is happening.

Tracing(Traces): involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system.

-> Tracing shows how it is happening.

* Monitoring helps us keep an eye on our systems to ensure they are working properly.

* Purpose: maintaining the health, performance, and security of IT environments.

* It enables early detection of issues, ensuring that they can be addressed before causing significant downtime or data loss.

We use monitoring to:

-> Detect Problems Early

-> Measure Performance

-> Ensure Availability

𝑾𝒉𝒚 𝑶𝒃𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 ? 

* Observability helps us understand why our systems are behaving the way they are.

* It’s like having a detailed map and tools to explore and diagnose issues.

We use observability to:

-> Diagnose Issues

-> Understand Behavior

-> Improve Systems

Metrics are measurements or data points that tell you what is happening.

Monitoring is the process of keeping an eye on these metrics over time to understand what’s normal, identify changes, and detect problems.

* Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.

* It can be configured and set up on both bare-metal servers and container environments like Kubernetes.
